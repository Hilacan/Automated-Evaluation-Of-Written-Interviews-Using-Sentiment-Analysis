The opportunities to tackle different projects are what draw me since Iâ€™m inclined to be solution-oriented. The opportunities to expand in this field are something that cannot be grasp anywhere else.  It's challenging and never redundant. I'm thrilled by the idea of working on projects in an environment I'm quite familiar with and working with people i look up to. For me, this opportunity offers an environment for me to expand professionally."]
